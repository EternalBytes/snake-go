# Console Snake Game in Go (Golang)

This snake game is a direct translation, from C to Go, of the Snake Game code from: [Console Snake Game in C](https://github.com/serene-dev/snake-c)

If you are learning Golang, make sure to read this code and get the most out of it.

NOTE: This code has been tested in Linux operating system only. To be more precise, I only tested on Ububtu Linux.
